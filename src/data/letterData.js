  content: `Dearest Cowpoke,

This old paper has seen more miles than Arthur’s hat, and I reckon this note has as much heart.
You’ve ridden these trails more times than anyone I know—through snow, through fire, through every last dinosaur bone.
You’re a true four-time legend, and I’m proud to call you partner.

Today, remember: you’re the reason camp feels like home.
May your journey stay golden, and your honor never fade.

With true respect,
Arthur Morgan`
